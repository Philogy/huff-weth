# (Simple) Huff WETH

**Notice:** This implementation is _outdated_, to see much more heavily optimized version of Wrapped
Ether written in Huff see the [newer METH project](https://github.com/philogy/meth-weth).

This project was made for the purpose of learning the new EVM language [Huff](https://huff.sh/).
I've rewritten the basic functionality of the classic Wrapped Ether contract aka
"WETH". Not fully tested just yet so there may still be some bugs to iron out.
